# WHAT-THE-CELL...-AND-WHERE-
Manually counting cells in microscopy samples, e.g., to test the efficacy of cancer drugs to selectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells, is a tedious and time-consuming effort. Here, we automated this process using deep learning algorithms to identify the location and size of cellular mass.
